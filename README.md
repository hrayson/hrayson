I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant](https://www.chu-lyon.fr/hopital-femme-mere-enfant) and Institut des Sciences Cognitives (CNRS) in Lyon. The main focus of my research is on neurocognitive development underlying social perception and social interaction, as well as the effects of early social experience on socio-cognitive and affective functioning. I use multimodal techniques including electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, behavioural observation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), longitudinal research designs, and advanced statistical methods.
