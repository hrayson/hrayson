# 💫 About Me:
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher, Research Project Manager, and Clinical Psychologist, based in Lyon, France. I am affiliated with the [Institut des Sciences Cognitives](https://isc.cnrs.fr) (CNRS), [Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant](https://www.chu-lyon.fr/hopital-femme-mere-enfant) (Lyon), and the [CHU Clermont-Ferrand](https://www.chu-clermontferrand.fr/).<br><br>
My research focuses on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying social perception and social interaction across early development, and on how early social experience, including adversity and parental psychopathology, shapes socio-cognitive and affective functioning. I adopt a developmental and mechanistic perspective, investigating how attentional, perceptual, and learning processes emerge and reorganise across infancy, and how these processes contribute to risk and resilience for later mental health outcomes.<br><br> 
Methodologically, my work relies on longitudinal, multimodal approaches combining electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, behavioural observation, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with advanced statistical and computational analyses. Through this work, I aim to bridge developmental cognitive neuroscience, social development, and clinical psychology, with the goal of identifying early, experience-sensitive mechanisms relevant to prevention and intervention.<br><br>
